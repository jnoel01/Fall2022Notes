- First normal form - the domain is atomic and if every column is in first normal form the table is in first normal form
- A “good table”:
    - is about one thing
    - is in 3NF/BCNF
- A decomposition is considered good if when the tables are decomposed then join together again they result in the same initial table
- A “bad” decomposition is called a “Lossy Decomposition”
- A “good” decomposition is called a “lossless-join decomposition”

---

- When designing a table we need to find out:
    1. R (The schema)
    2. Functional Dependencies (func dependency) ← describes the relationships among columns ← an example would be a primary key functionally determines Name column (such as CWID → Name)
    
    Both of these parameters are determined by the business
    
- If a table is good, do nothing if a table is bad decompose them via their primary key

- Functional Dependencies:
    - Is generally in the form of x → y (left hand side determines right hand side, primary keys on the left and other attributes on the right)

    - Because in tuple1 the X value is 10 and the Y value is A then it must be true that Y in tuple2 is also equal to A
