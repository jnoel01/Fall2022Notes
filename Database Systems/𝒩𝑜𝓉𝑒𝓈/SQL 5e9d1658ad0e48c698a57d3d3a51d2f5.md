# SQL

- delete T = delete “logged transaction” (you can undo this action because of the log)
- truncate table T = ”non-logged” (removed content) (you can not undo this action unless there is a backup)
- drop table T = removed whole structure
- ************select clause =******** project operator*
- ************************where clause =**************** select operator*
- between clause sets a domain - where ******amount****** **************************************************between 90000************************************************** and **************************************************1000000**************************************************

***************Rename Operation***************

- The SQL allows renaming relations and attributes using the ****as**** clause
- Find the customer names and their loan numbers for all customer having a loan at some branch

************************************************String Operations************************************************

- SQL includes a string matching operator for comparisons on character strings. The operator “like” uses patterns that are described using two special characters
    - percent(%) - The % character matches any substring
    - underscore(_) - The _ character matches any character
- Find the names of all customers whosr street includes the substring “Main”:
    
    ```sql
    select customer_name
    from customer
    where customer_street like '% Main%'
    ```
    
- Match the name “Main%”
    
    ```sql
    like 'Main\%' escape '\'
    ```
    
- Concatenate strings using ||

***************************************Ordering the Display of Tuples***************************************

- List in alphabetic order the names of all customers having a loan in Perryride branch
    
    ```sql
    select distinct customer_name
    from borrow,loan
    where borrower loan_number = loan.loan_number and branch_name = "Perryride"
    order by customer_name
    ```
    
- We may specify desc for descending order or asc for ascending order, for each attribute; ascending order is the default
    - Example: ************************order by************************ **************customer_name************** ********desc********

******************************Duplicates******************************

- In relations with duplicates, SQL can define how many copies of tuples appear in the result
- ******************Multiset****************** versions of some of the relational algebra operators-given multiset relations r1 and r2

***************************************Set Operators***************************************

- If you want to remove all duplicates use distinct

- Aggregate functions do not apply to null values
-
