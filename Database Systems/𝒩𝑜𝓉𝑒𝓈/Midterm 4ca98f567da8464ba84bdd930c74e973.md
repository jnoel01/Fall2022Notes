### ************************************************************************Difference between Keys:************************************************************************

- A super key is anything that can be unique and used to identify rows of data (email, student id, etc.).
- A candidate key is anything that can be broken down from a super key. (it is the minimal set of super keys)
    - Example: if our super key combinations are email, student id, registration code our candidate keys would be email, student id, and registration code (INDIVIDUAL).

- A primary key is a  candidate key chose to uniquely identify each row of data in a table
    - A primary key value cannot be null and a primary key value cannot be a duplicate
- Whichever left over keys are not chosen as the primary key are alternate keys

- A foreign key connects two relationships,
- Composite key is a key with multiple candidate keys in it
- Surrogate key, if a relation has no attribute which can be used to identify the rows, we will create an attribute that is unique for this purpose, but it will had no meaning to the data

### ************************************************Sets vs. Multi-Set************************************************

- Multiset allows for duplicate values. If we were to have a set r1 and r2 where r1= {(1 , a) (2 , a)} and r2 = { (2) , (3), (4) } then ΠB(r1) would be

{ (a), (a) } because we are selecting only the be values from R1 set.

the multiset of of selecting B from r1 x r2 (ΠB (r1) x r2) would be

{ (a ,2) (a,2), (a,3), (a,3), (a,3), (a,3) }

 The multiset version expression is

- The set operations union, intersect, and expect operations automatically eliminate duplicates.
- To KEEP DUPLICATES use the corresponding multiset version union all, intersect all and except all!

- INTERSECT - only rows in common in both are selected
- UNION- rows in either set are selected
    - For union to be valid they must have the same number of attributes
- EXCEPT - take only rows in a set that do not appear in the other set

*********************************************************Aggregate Functions*********************************************************

avg: average value

min: minimum value

max: maximum value

sum: sum of values

count: number of values

** These functions operate on the multiset of values

**DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values

************NULL VALUES************

- Any comparison with ****null**** returns ****unknown****
- Three-valued logic using truth value unknown:
    - (unknown or true) = true
    - (unknown or false) = unknown
    - (unknown or unknown) unknown
    - (true and unknown) = unknown
    - (false and unknown) = false
    - (unknown and unknown) = unknown

******************************************RELATION, DOMAIN, ATOMIC DOMAIN******************************************

- Atomic domain: Meaning that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the relational model is concerned
- Domain: The list of acceptable value that a column in allowed to contain
- Relation: Refers to a table anything that stores the relation between data in its column-row format. A single row of a table, which contains a single record for that relation is called a tuple

*********CARTESIAN PRODUCT VS. JOINS*********

This is union: Union combines data into new rows

This is natural join:
