# M1.B4: Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through the Agile Manifesto we have come to value:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

**There are 12 total ideas in the Agile Manifesto:**

1. *Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software*
2. *Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage*
3. *Deliver working software frequently, from a couple weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale*
4. *Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project*
5. *Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.*
6. *The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to face conversation*
7. *Working software is a primary measure of progress*
8. *Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely*
9. *Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility*
10. *Simplicity— the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential*
11. *The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing team*
12. *At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts their behavior accordingly.*

### ***The 12 Extreme Programming (XP) Practices***

***The Planning Game***

- Business people decide:
    - scope
    - priority
    - release dates
- Technical people decide:
    - estimates of effort
    - technical consequences
    - process
    - detailed scheduling

***Small Releases***

- Every release should be as small as possible
- Every release must completely implement its new features
- Every release should contain the most valuable business features
    - Contrast with RUP where you focus on the biggest risk first

***Metaphor***

- Metaphor is a simple explanation of the project
    - Agreed upon by all members of team
    - Simple enough for customers to understand
    - Detailed enough to drive architecture (apple, iPhone)
- Metaphors replaces architecture 10,000 feet view of the system

***Simple Design***

- Successfully runs all tests
- Has no duplicated logic
- States every intention important to programmers
- Has the fewest possible classes and methods

***Testing***

- Any feature without an automated test does NOT EXIST
- Programmers need confidence in correct operations
- Customers need confidence in correct operation

***Refactoring***

- “Hey business parters, we need some time to refactor our code”
- Rewrite or restructure the code to improve the implementation
- Always ask stakeholders if theres a way to make the program simpler
- When the system requires duplication of code, it’s asking for refactoring
- Can always find a series of small, low-risk steps

***Pair Programming***

- All code written with two people at 2 machines
- Driver: Thinks about best way to implement
- Navigator: thinking about viability to approach, thinks of new tests, simpler ways to do things
- They switch roles frequently

***Collective Ownership***

- Anybody who sees an opportunity to add value to any portion of the code is required to do so
- Everyone knows something about everything
- Everyone feels obligated to make improvements

***Continuous Integration***

- Integrate and test every few hours, at least once per day
    - Don’t wait until the very end to being integration
    - All tests must pass
- Easy to tell who broke code
    - Problem is likely to be in the code that was most recently changed

***Sustainable Pace***

- People should be able to go to work, do it and have time off.
- Overtime is a symptom of a serious problem
- XP only allows one week of overtime

***Whole Team***

- Customer is a member of the team
- Programmers need to ask questions of a real customer
- Customer sits with team

***Coding Standards***

- Everyone edits everyone’s codes
- Standard should require least amount of overhead
- Standards should be adopted voluntarily by the team

***Workspace***

- Collaborative, open workspace
