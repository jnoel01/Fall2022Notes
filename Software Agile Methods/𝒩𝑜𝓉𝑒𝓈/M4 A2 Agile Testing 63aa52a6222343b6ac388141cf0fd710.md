# M4.A2: Agile Testing

***Agile Testing***

- Testing is NOT a separate phase with Agile Methods
    - Instead, testing is integrated into every step
- Focus on automated testing and continuous integration
    - Find problems as quickly as possible
    - Except frequent changes, so facilitate them
    

***Agile: Unit Testing***

- Ensures that recently completed unit is correct
    - Who- Developers using automated testing platforms
    - What- New features or bug fixes Code/branch coverage
    - When- Tests written before the code is written. Run tests while developing code

***Agile Testing: Integration Testing***

- Ensures that components, potentially written by different developers, integrate cleanly and work together
    - Who- Developers using automates tests platforms with tests written during development
    - What- Test all modules from all developers
    - When- Continuously: at least once per day if not on every code check in using existing tests

***Agile Testing: Regression Testing***

- Verify that changes haven’t introduced new problems in already tested code
    - Who- Developers using automated test platforms with tests written before code is written
    - What- Entire system or selected components
    - When- After changes to code for bug fixes or new features

***Agile Testing: System Testing***

- Ensures that complete system is correct
- May include functionality, performance, stress testing, etc.
    - Who- Developers using automated test platforms with tests written during development
    - What- Test complete system performance security stress testing
    - When- Optional: may be done before product release cycle after several sprint
    

***Agile Testing: Acceptance Testing***

- User verifies that the system performs as expected and meets requirements
    - Who- Product Owner, stakeholders
    - What- Overall system, including new features from latest sprint
    - When- Sprint Review

***Customer bug reports?***

- Agile Methods’ focus on automated testing and continuous integration helps to reduce, but doesn’t eliminate bugs found by customers
- Scrum adds new features each sprint
    - How are bugs tracked?
    - When are bugs fixed?
- Add bugs as user stories to product back log
    - Product owner determines how important the bug fix is and organizes product backlog
