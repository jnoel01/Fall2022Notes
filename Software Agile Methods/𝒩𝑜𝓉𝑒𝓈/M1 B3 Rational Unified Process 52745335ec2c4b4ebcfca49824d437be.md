- Control Changes

- Verify software quality
- Control changes to software

***RUP project lifecycle phases***

- Inception**:** scope system for cost and budget, create basic use-case model
- Elaboration: mitigate risks by elaborations of use case model and design of software architecture
- Construction: Implement and test software
- Transition: Plan and execute delivery of system to customer
- Each phase ends with a milestone when stakeholders review progress and make go/no-go decisions

- RUP supporting disciplines are configurations and change managements, project management and environment
    - Environment meaning sure that the process, guidance and tools are available
