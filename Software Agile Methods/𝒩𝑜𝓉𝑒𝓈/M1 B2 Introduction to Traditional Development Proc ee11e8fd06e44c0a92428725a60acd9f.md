# M1.B2:Introduction to Traditional Development Processes

- Programming is usually less than 1/4 of the total effort - on large scale projects its 1/6
- Software projects fail due to poor planning, not understanding requirements, poor quality and failure to respond to problems

### *What problems are we trying to solve in any SDLC?*

1. Software Specification - what functionality must we support?
2. Software Development - How do we create the software that delivers the functionality?
3. Software Validation - How do we verify that the software does what it’s supposed to?
4. Software Evolution - How does the software evolve to meet customer needs?

**SDLC Methods**

- Rigid meaning that it is not going to change
    - Software for an XRay machine won’t change for 10/20 yrs
- If requirements are flexible and you’ll have multiple releases use these methods:
    - Spiral
    - Iterative
    - Agile Method
    - Chaos/Big Bang

### *Waterfall Model*

### *When is it appropriate?*

- Plan everything perfect so it’s done right the first time
- Popular traditional approach for engineers (building bridges)
- Very formal process
    - Extensive documentation
    - Serial Execution
- Must complete all requirements before moving on to next stage
- Strict handoffs between stages - signed in blood
- Must complete testing before every step

- Must be right first time
    - Cost of failure is VERY high
- Critical systems with extreme safety or security requirements
- Airplanes, self-driving cars, runways

### *Boehm’s Spiral Model*

- Recognized the limits of Waterfall
    - Hard to get right first time
- He focused on risk assessment
- Encourages incremental developments
- Each Spiral Includes:
    - Objective setting
    - Risk assessment and reduction
    - Development and validation
    - Planning

***Iterative Models SDLC Benefits***

- Recognizes limitations of Waterfall
- Identify requirements up front
- Build subsets of requirements
- Requirements are mostly stable but can change
- Works well for large projects being developed in parallel
- Delivers early for customers to review
