# M2.A2: User Stories

***User Stories: Agile Approach***

- **Customers** communicate their needs via short statements
    - **Customers** provide the user stories with help from developers
    - Each User Story is a reminder for the customer and developer to discuss the issue
- Each statement describes the goals of an actor
    - “As a user I want to…”
- **Customer** should decide **priority**  of each user story

*Example:  **MSS Play song***

“*As a user I want to be able to play a song so I can listen to it from beginning to end so I can hear the song”*

Priority I user story is listed above

***3 C’s of User Stories***

**Developers help to elaborate user stories**

- Sometimes user stories need elaboration to explain exactly what is needed
    - Customers and developers resolve any ambiguities
- A **developer** estimates the **effort** required for each user story
    - Example: MSS play song - 2 story points

***User Story Components***

- **Title:**  a short handle for the story. Present tense verb in active voice is desirable
- **Acceptance test:**  How are we going to prove what we’re developing is actually going to work? It’s a method to prove to the business that the dev team is completing what they're supposed to
- **Priority:**  decided by the customer
- **Story points:** estimated time to implement expressed in relative units
- **Description:** one to three sentences describing the story

***Criteria for User Stories***

- Each story should add value to the customer
- Customers write user stories (with help from developers if needed)
- Stories need to be small enough that several can be completed per iteration
    - Replace big stories with several smaller stories
- Stories should be independent (as much as possible)
- Stories must be testable- like any requirements, if it cannot be tested, its not a requirement!
- Include non-functional requirements as User Stories

***INVEST in User Stories***

- *Independent* in context and scheduling

- *Negotiable*  between customer and developers

- *Valuable* to the customer

- *Estimable*  value to customer & effort for developers

- *Small* in scope

- T*estable* include sufficient detail to allow testing

***User story: play song example***

***Estimating time for User Stories***

- Developers estimate how long each story will take
- Estimates are expressed in Story Points
    - Relative measure of effort
- But, how do they know how long a new story will take?
    - previous experience
    - similar stories on project
    - user a consensus process to compare estimates
    

***Planning Poker***

- **Goal:** estimate relative effort for each user story
- **Participants:**
    - **Developers** estimate effort
    - **Scrum Maste**r optimizes the process
    - **Product owner** answers questions
- **Process:**
    - For each user story:
        - Describe the user story
        - Each developer assigns effort
        - Continue until consensus
        

***Limitations of User Stories***

- User Stories come from XP
    - Small teams with engages customers
- What can go wrong?
    - Lack of look-ahead- Developers need quick responses from customers and What if the appropriate customer isn’t available when needed?
    - Lack of context- not entirely specific because user stories are expressed in simple concise statements
    - Lack of completeness- no one approves/signs and track who gave it to you
    

 ***When to use which? User Stories vs. Use Cases***

- **User Stories** are more flexible and easier to write
    - Ideal for small projects:
        - Where a dedicated customer responds to questions
        - Where a small team can deliver the entire solution
- **Use Cases** are more rigorous
    - May be better for larger projects
    - Where risks are higher
