# M10.B1: Assignment: Homework Assignment 10: Crystal

```
For each different color of the Crystal family of methods, there are different 
assumptions about the project and different expectations of the project team. In general, the process becomes more formal as the risks of the project increase. 

So far, you've worked on three different features in your role as Agile Methods consultant for Driverless Cars. Identify and justify the appropriate Crystal 
family method for each of the features:

-Self parking, where the car parks itself without human assistance
-Automatic lane change, where the car changes lanes automatically when the 
driver hits the turn signal
-Honking the horn when appropriate to warn pedestrians and other drivers

Be sure to justify your response with data about the method. Don't just say that Crystal Clear is appropriate for all three tasks because you don't want to think about a better answer.

1.) For self parking, I believe that the best Crystal family method would be Crystal Red. This is because the self parking is a medium sized project and a variety of teams are involved in developing; i.e sensor team, ui/ux team, software engineers etc.. It is noted that Crystal Red follow more of a traditional software method and this is important because this feature will need thorough documentation, as the risk is high.

2.) Automatic lane change should be Crystal Sapphire/Diamond. This is because lane change has many different components to it, similar to the self parking however lane change is often used on highways where individuals are going at high speeds. These high speeds are obviously fatal and any project which is considered a risk to society is categorized under Crystal Sapphire and Diamond.

3.) For the honking horn feature I believe that Crystal Yellow would be appropriate. This feature is of smaller scale, however it does require both a sensor team (to recognize pedestrians/when to honk) and electrical/software engineers. Because multiple teams are needed, the project is short-term and automated testing will be utilized Crystal Yellow is the best fit.
