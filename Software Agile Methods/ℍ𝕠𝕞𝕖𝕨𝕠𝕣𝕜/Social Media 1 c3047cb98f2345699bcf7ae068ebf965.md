Have We Taken Agile Too Far?

[https://hbr.org/2021/04/have-we-taken-agile-too-far](https://hbr.org/2021/04/have-we-taken-agile-too-far)

Two ex tech executives at Amazon, Colin Bryar and Bill Carr’s, believe that companies may have taken Agile too far. Truly after the reading the article, I think that it’s less that we have taken “Agile Too Far” and more that company teams are not adhering the the Agile Manifesto. Both authors claim that developers are using Agile to avoid careful planning and preparation. That because developers are able to release a product iteratively and quickly using Agile Methodologies it doesn’t have to be perfect which causes them to be more lazy and overlook a variety of errors that are somewhat important. Companies utilizing Agile may give their customers a glimpse at the product “too fast” then develop “too slow” which ultimately ends in high hopes for the customer and a poor quality product being released in the end. Both authors highlight how Amazon’s method of “working-backwards” which  creates a fully realized vision of a product, all of the stakeholders agreements and then finally development and release. The article focuses heavily on how Agile promotes fast paced working and attempts to *only* get out a minimum viable product, so they don’t ever end up achieving what the product should. Bryar and Carr’s “worst outcome” is when developers decide to make two kinds of compromises: when the team doesn’t take the time to develop a new capability and goes with their current skill set which hinders potential growth and secondly, when a team curtail their ambitions on a product and prepare something unsustainable. In the end the authors don’t completely knock Agile Methodologies and see them as effective when used *properly*.

When the authors say that the Agile Method must be used “properly” that is a key indicator that it’s not “taking agile too far” but more that the utilizers of Agile are not adhering to the Agile Manifesto. This article instead of making it seem like they are blaming teams, are coming across as quite literally blaming Agile Methodologies. I feel as those when the processes are done correctly, with attention to detail and quality (which is stressed in the manifesto) these issues that Bryar and Carr brought up probably wouldn’t be happening. I think the others had the right idea that work culture is using Agile Methodologies incorrectly, but that’s not to say that its Agile’s fault. The article is quite misleading and tries to push pride and bias their ex company, Amazon. The “working-backwards” method they use is loose and quite similar to Agile in my opinion, so I’m not sure what they think is special about it? Overall I would not recommend this read to people, it’s misleading.
