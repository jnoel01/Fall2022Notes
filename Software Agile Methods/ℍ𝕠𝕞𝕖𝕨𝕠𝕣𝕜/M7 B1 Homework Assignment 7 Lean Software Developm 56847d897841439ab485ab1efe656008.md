Complete this assignment after you have completed the Lean Software Development: A 
Tutorial Links to an external site. reading and have watched the videos in this module. 
Provide the answers to the following and then submit your document:

In the reading assignment this week, Poppendieck and Cusumano point out that some of the principles of the lean philosophy have been practiced by software developers in the 
past, before Agile methods like XP and Scrum were invented. Describe how Microsoft 
applied lean principles according to the Poppendieck paper.

Value stream mapping is an important tool used by the lean team.  Describe Value Stream mapping.

Describe your GEDCOM team's current process (you don't need to draw a diagram),including how you communicate, how you integrate code from each team member, how you test code
from all test members, and how you package and submit the results. Evaluate your GEDCOM team's current process and identify waste in your process. 

Describe a new process for your team to follow to eliminate waste in your team's current process.

Use complete sentences; provide thorough and thoughtful responses to each prompt. 
Clearly identify each response.

1.) Microsoft applied lean principles according to the Poppendieck paper in a variety of ways similar to that of Toyota's lean production. A few of the ways were development by small-scale features, scheduling by features and milestones, automating build tools and quick tests, focusing on small, multifunctional teams, and continuous integration testing. Lean focusing on eliminating waste, amplifying learning, delivering fast as possible and empowering the team. The aforementioned Microsoft development steps focus on these lean principles because they form small teams and continuously do integration testing allowing for flexibility and not “putting all your eggs in one basket”. By working in small intervals, not too much work is done in the case the project ever needs to pivot.

2.) Value Stream Mapping is the process of mapping out how a projects flow is in that current time. By mapping out the flow one can identify the current flow, where delays in the flow are, where idles times in the flow are, and ultimately where waste is so that it can be removed. After this analyzation one can create a future flow/map that is more optimized and reiterate to continuously optimize the map. 

3.) Our teams current process is very intimate because there are only three of us who are working on it. Since we all have very flexible schedules, most of the time we just message one another to see when we are free and then all work on the code at the same time using VSCode live share. We divide the amount of user stories that we planned for in Sprint Planning by three (we always just do 2 stories each to complete 6 total user stories a week). Because we are coding simultaneously it is easy for us to integrate code because we just discuss how we are going to code and then fix any discrepancies before beginning to code.  The test cases are written prior to coding and after the code is done we just run the module collectively and together work on any cases that failed. After someone fills out the chart, we do sprint planning, using the “Prettier” extension in VSCode to make the code spacing better, and submit it. Some waste that is in our process is all of us having to code together. Often times if someone is running the code, we can not be coding because then there will be errors and the test cases wont compile. Another waste is deciding which day to work, even though it only takes a few minutes to sort out, it could be better if we just decided on a day and stuck to that.

4.) A new process that our team could adopt would be having a fixed schedule that says what we’ll be doing each day of the Sprint. For example, we tend to do everything in 1-1.5 hours. It may be more thoughtful if we planned separate days for development, testing and reflection. This way we can look at our code/project with a fresh mind. Also, this would eliminate the waste of us spending time to decided which hour/day we can work. Besides that, I think once a day is sorted we should continue coding together simultaneously using VSCode “live share”, but open different environments to test our code so that we don’t have to wait for someone to finish their code before we can test. I think it’s important that we code simultaneously because we are all Computer Science students and most of the stories we implement aren’t very timely, but our thought processes are very different so if we were to code them individually it would waste more time trying to integrate our code together (rather than just verbally saying which path we’re going to take, agreeing that it’ll integrate fine and then starting to code). After, I think one of us could do the Excel Sprint Planning sheet while the other works on “Prettying” the code. This way we can submit it more efficiently. If the Sprint Planning already has a skeleton formed all we would need to do as a group is agree on it, make and tweaks and then submit the code with it.
