# M3.B1: Assignment: Homework Assignment 3: User Story

```
1.) Provide an overall description of the Scrum process and roles.
```

The roles involved in the Scrum Process are:

1.) **Scrum Master:** Responsible for the performance of the development team and acts as a servant for scrum. They help to promote efficient and effective work and find ways to better these aspects of the team.

2.) **Development Team:** Responsible for creating or “developing” the product that the stakeholders want. They should be able to self-organize and support one another to solve complex issues that arise during development

3.) **Product Owner:** Responsible for creating and maintaining the backlog, communicating with the stakeholders and customers to create the vision as well as dictating which features are the most critical to the project.

The Scrum process consists of five events: **Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective**. In Sprint planning a product backlog is created as well as the assess, sprint goals are set, forecasting for the completion time of each item and overall outlining what the Sprint will look like. Daily Scrum is next, it is a daily call/meeting where the developers and Scrum master inform each other of their progress and any blockers. After Daily Scrum there is Sprint Review, in this event the time will meet and demonstrate the work to the other development team, scrum master, product owner and sometimes the stakeholders. The work is then reviewed and determined complete or not. The next event is Sprint Retrospective, which occurs at the end of the sprint. During this event the development team assesses what aspects of their work went well and what they could do better during the next sprint. Lastly, there is product Refinement, in refinement the product backlog is maintenance and made ready for the next sprint.

```
2.) Explain the planning process for Sprint 1. Who is involved? What are the
work products? What are the roles and deliverables of each participant? Who
delivers what and when?
```

The planning process for Sprint 1 will go as followed:

The Product Owner will decide which features are of most importance, write the issue type in whichever planning software we are using, for example Jira. Then during Sprint planning, the team will assess the sprint goals, outline the sprint and estimate the completion time. The three features Driverless cars team will be working on during this three week Sprint are:

1.) Pressing the park button to launch the process

2.) When the car has found spot, the car will “ding” 3 times to notify you that a spot has been found

3.) When the car begins parking, the words “PARKING” will appear on a driver dashboard until the process is finished

Our team will decide how many stories points each of these features are worth when playing pointer poker.

The dev team, scrum master and possibly product owner will meet each day during Daily Scrum to assess the progress on each of the features. Once all features are completed, around 2-2.5 weeks into the Sprint, the team will have Sprint review to review the work and determine if it is complete and make any changes to the aforementioned features. The dev team and scrum master are responsible for the efficiency and delivery of each feature. Next, there will be Sprint Retrospective where the dev team and scrum master discuss what aspects of the sprint could have been done better and what went well. Lastly, the team will have product refinement where the dev team and product owner can discuss the backlog and next sprint. This process will be fully completed in approximately 3 weeks.

```
3.) Describe what happens, day to day, during Sprint 1. Who is involved? What
are the work products?
```

Day to Day, during sprint 1, the development team will meet for 15 minutes to discuss the progress of the Sprint Goal and any blockers that they may have that would push back the release of the Sprint goal. The following feature’s progress will be discussed throughout the meeting: 

1.) Pressing the park button to launch the process

2.) When the car has found spot, the car will “ding” 3 times to notify you that a spot has been found

3.) When the car begins parking, the words “PARKING” will appear on a driver dashboard until the process is finished

The developers can make any actionable plans for the next day of work, and decisions to progress the Sprint,

```
4.) Describe what happens at the end of Sprint 1. Who is involved? What are the work products?
```

At the end of Sprint 1, there will be product backlog grooming. During this event the Driverless cars team will assess the backlog and order it for the next sprint. The scrum team and product owner will attend this meeting and ask questions that may arrive in the Sprint 2 Planning meeting. The questions will be focused to the product who will help the dev team understand which features are critical for the Driverless cars software success.

```
5.) How does the team measure progress?
```

There are multiple ways to measure progress when using the Scrum process of agile methodology. One measure of progress would be to sum the story points achieved. Another way would be creating a burndown chart that represents the about of work left to do vs. time. Another type of chart used for measuring progress is a burnup chart where the chart represents the sprint completed work compared to the total scope of the project. Once other features for the Driverless Car project are determined all of the aforementioned “progress measurers” can be put to use.

```
6.) How and when can the team adjust priorities? Who sets the priorities? When can changes be made?
```

The person who sets priority is the Product Owner. He or she can adjust priorities in the product backlog at anytime. This is because the product owner is the one responsible for communicating with the stakeholders, the ultimately have pull one which item sin the backlog should be prioritized for the best product development result.
