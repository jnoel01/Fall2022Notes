***The “But” Syndrome***

There are many companies that are using Agile Methodologies just to say “we are using Agile”. It has been seen as a trend to use Agile Methodology, but what is the point is saying your team is Agile when they’re not? The author suggests that it is very common to hear a team say “We have been using the waterfall methodology still” or “We still need to produce loads of documentations”. The author highlights to team that uses these “buts” that there is more reward when your team is trustworthy with the process, customer and that the team is able to adapt to change. Steps one can take to remove “Buts” in a company would be start early, communicate greatly with the customer and stakeholders, and potentially get an Agile coach. In conclusion, by reiterating the Agile Methodology and sticking to the guide a team can properly be “Agile”.

I would definitely recommend this article. After working 2 years in industry as a software engineer and product owner, there is a lot of bad practices in the SDLC and many think that they are still Agile, when in reality they are not. This article is a good reminder for teams to stay true to the method and promote more efficient communication.
