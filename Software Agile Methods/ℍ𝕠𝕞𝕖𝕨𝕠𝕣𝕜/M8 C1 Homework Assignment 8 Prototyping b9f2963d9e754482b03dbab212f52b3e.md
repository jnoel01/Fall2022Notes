# M8.C1: Homework Assignment 8: Prototyping

```
Prototyping plays a major role in DSDM. One of its main purposes is to replace 
documentation describing the final product with a working version of the 
product. That is, DSDM emphasizes the creation of software artifacts rather than documents in order to capture requirements and design intentions. 

1.) Describe at least two advantages of using prototypes rather than documents 
for the self-parking car software we discussed in earlier assignments.

2.) Describe at least two risks of using prototypes rather than documents for 
the self-parking car software we discussed in earlier assignments. What could 
possibly go wrong?

3.) Your consulting customers at DriverlessCars have asked you to build a 
prototype of a software module that would allow cars to change lanes at 
highway speeds simply by turning on the turn signal. Will you deliver a 
prototype or will you convince the customers that extensive documentation 
along with the prototype is a better plan? Justify your decision by 
describing the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of delivering just a 
prototype versus a prototype plus extensive analysis and documentation.

1.) One advantage of using prototypes rather than documents is that the customer can get a real-time interaction with the system and assess where it could be improved. Also with that, the failure rate can be lessened because clients and developers are able to rectify any errors found in the system at an earlier stage. With documentation, the clients are unable to get a “good feel” of the system, especially if the documentation is technical-heavy and the clients are not IT literate. With the self-parking project, viewing the UI/UX software as a prototype whilst driving would allow Driverless Car clients to determine if the interface is safe to use while driving/ if the interface buttons are in convenient positions.

2.) One risk of using prototypes rather than documents for the self-parking car software would be the risk involved. Since the car must be able to park in conditions where there are surrounding parked cars, it could potentially damage the cars or in an extreme case, nearby pedestrians. Another risk would be, the large sum of money to buy a training “course” to test the autonomous vehicle. Presumably they would not be testing it out in the public; as mentioned before that would pose great risk. This would mean that the company has to shell out a decent amount of money to test the cat which could be detrimental to the company’s business depending on their current available budget. Lastly, prototyping could lead stakeholders to either become too pushy or stop funding the project. When seeing a working prototype their reaction could be “You’re done with everything let’s go into production”, even when the company is not ready or they may deem it’s not going to be profitable and back out of the project.

3.) If the consulting customers as DriverlessCars had asked me to create a prototype I would tell them that it would be better to provide extensive documentation along with the prototype. The prototype should be the final step in testing. This is because the risks of a self-driving car are high, so it is important to capture all potential risks in documentation, then create mapping/flow of the lange changing process. After showing the clients the documentation and flow, there should be a drawn prototype of the interface/dashboard/anything that will show while the lane changing software is active. Any tweaks can be made, then a physical prototype can be made. The advantage of waiting to make a physical prototype can save a lot of money, as car manufacturing is expensive. A disadvantage is that the clients will be unable to physically interact with the system and this may cause DriverlessCars to have to rework their system if the client deems it not sufficient enough. The cost of multiple prototypes can be lessened if documentation is covered first.
