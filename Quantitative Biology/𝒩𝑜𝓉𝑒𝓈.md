Modeling of pattern in Nature, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature)

- Uses Fibonacci to identify patterns

Neural nets, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

- data set examples, forest fires
- Typically CS students will work on this
- Most people that take this know a lot about neural networks and how to build them

The Self-Thinning Rule in Plant Biology,

- highly specialized topic
- requires a lot of data mining
- its self determined, if you take this you know what you’ll do for the rest of the semester and there’s no originality and you’ll HAVE to stick to that type of analysis
