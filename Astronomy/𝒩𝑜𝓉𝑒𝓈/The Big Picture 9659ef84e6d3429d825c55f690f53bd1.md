# The Big Picture

- We are the center of the observable universe
- We are part of a large structure
- AU = Astronomical Unit which is defined as the *average* distance between the Earth and the Sun (1.5 * 10^8 km)
- light-year is not a unit of time but of distance - the distance traveled by light in a years time (light-year > AU… about 9.46*10^12 km)
- Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to get to Earth, that distance is 8 *light-minutes*
- We are part of the Milky way galaxy which is part of the Local Group
    - The local group is made up of 70 galaxies
    - Andromeda and the Milky way are the largest in the Local Group
- The Local Group is part of the super galaxy
- The is part of the Large-Scale Structure (looks like a spider web)
    - It is filled with sheets, filaments, voids
    
- The Andromeda Galaxy (also called M31) is about 2.5 million light-years away from us
- Andromeda is 100,000 light-years across
- A note about our Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda: they will collide in 4 billion years

- Movements of Earth through space:
    - Orbit around the sun
    - Rotation of the Earth
    
- Stars in the local solar neighborhood move randomly relatively to one another at typical speeds of 70k km/hr
- The galaxy’s rotation carries us around the galactic center at about 800k km/hr
- All galaxy are moving away from each other → the universe is expanding (on the large scale things are expanding)
    - Locally the solar system does not expand bc gravity and other forces
    
    - The whole human civilization only happened in the last half-minute if the history of the universe is compressed in 1 year
        - Modern humans achievements are all done in the last half-minute if the universe was compressed into 1 year
        - TLDR we are really late in time but have done a lot
    
    ***Mass and Density Scale***
    
    - Observed Mass Ranges of Compact Objects:
        - white dwarf → neutron star → stellar black hole → intermediate black hole → supermassive black hole
        
    - To understand how compact things are we need both mass and density
    - Density of a white dwarf (max 1.4 solar mass) is fitting the mass into the size of the Earth
    - Density of Neutron Star (1.4 -3 solar mass)
    
    - A solar mass black hole has a (Schwarzschild) radius of 3km
    - A 10 solar mass black hole has a radius of 30km ← is less dense (the larger the black hole radius, the less dense it is)
