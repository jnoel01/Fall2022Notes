# PEP 151 Lab 2 Report Distance Determination from Cepheid Variable Stars

Name: Jessica Noel

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

***I. Introduction***

During this lab we measured distance using the variable star Delta Cepheid. Utilizing the pulsation period of Delta Cepheid we were able to determine the luminosity and from the luminosity-period relation. I used the given data set to plot the Light Curve Relation: Time (in hours) vs. Apparent Magnitude (m). From this plot (as shown below) I found the approximate period to be 130 hours or 5.4 days and the average apparent magnitude of Delta Cephei to be 3.91. I found the apparent magnitude by using the equation

 $m = (max apparent magnitude + minapparentmagnitude) / 2$

I then needed to plot the Luminosity-Period Relation, Period (in days) vs. Absolute Magnitude (M) to calculate the line of best fit. Using this line y = -1.062ln(x) - 1.6065 I plugged in my pulsation period of 5.4 days and found that the absolute magnitude is Absolute Magnitude:-3.39745568869. With both of these found I can use the apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude to calculate the distance: $m - M = 2.5log10[(d/10)^2]$.

Using this equation I found the distance to Delta Cepheid to be approximately 289.39431 parsec.

***III. Results***

From the light curve above, I have determine that the pulsation period of “delta Cephei” to be 130 hours or 5.4 days.

From the light curve, I have also determined the average apparent magnitude of “delta Cephei” to be m = 3.91 W/m2

From the luminosity-period relation plot and use the pulsation period I have determine above, I estimate the absolute magnitude of “delta Cephei” to be M = -3.39745568869

Using the relation between apparent magnitude m and absolute magnitude M: m-M=2.5log10(d/10)^2, I have calculated the distance d to be ~289.39431 parsecs

Looking up resources online, the established value for the distance to “Delta Cephei” is 271.9861 parsecs, which shows i have a percent error of 6.4004%.
