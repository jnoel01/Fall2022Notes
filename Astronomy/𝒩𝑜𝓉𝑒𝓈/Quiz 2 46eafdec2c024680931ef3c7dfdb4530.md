# Quiz 2

******************************Chapter 13******************************

- The asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter - this region is called the asteroid belt
- Asteroids can not be seen with a telescope
- Giovanni Piazzi found the first asteroid in 1801
    - He thought it was a minor planet
- Heidelberg introduces astronomical photography to search for asteroids
- Dark asteroids are ******************primitive****************** bodies
- **Primitive bodies:** Those that have changed little chemically since the beginning of the solar system (C-TYPE)
- S - Type: stony or silicate composition, higher reflectivity and clearer spectral signatures of silicate minerals
- M-Type: metallic, better reflection than S-type
- Distance from the sun (closest to farthest): M-type, S-type, C-type

- Comets are icy composition so they brighten dramatically as they approach the sun
- When looking at a comet we normally see a the temporary atmosphere of gas and dust illuminated by the sun, the atmosphere is called coma/comets head
- We can see comets because of the evaporation of cometary ices heated by sunlight
- A comet’s tail is an extension of its atmosphere and is made up of the same stuff as the head
- The tail of the comet always faces away from the sun because it is repulsed force driving particles away from the head
- The dust tail points away from the sun, the gas tail is parallel to the sun and the dust trail is perpendicular to the sun
- The Oort cloud (outer orbiting tings) help us sample material formed very far from the sun

******************************Chapter 14******************************

- When fragments of interplanetary dust strikes Earth’s atmosphere it burn up to create a meteor
- Dust particles that travel through space together produce meteor showers
    - We see meteor showers from a diverging part in the sky called the radiant of the shower
- Meteorites are debris from space that survive to reach the surface of the earth
- Giant planets can migrate inward from their place of formation where it is cold enough for ice to form (hot jupiters)
- Small (terrestrial) type rocky planets are common in our galaxy

******************************Chapter 15******************************

- Layers of the Sun:
    - Photosphere: Lowest layer of the Sun’s atmosphere, emits most of the Sun’s visible light
    - Chromosphere: less dense
    - Corona: outermost layer of the atmosphere/ extremely hot
    - Sunspots: only look dark because they are cooler compared to the surroundings
- sunspots have a strong magnetic field and the iron absorption line splits in three
- sunspots appear in pairs and groups
- polarity reverses every max/min cycle (solar cycle is 22 yrs)

- solar flares - due to change in magnetic field bursts of UV, X rays photons and charged particles are emitted
- coronal mass ejection - large volumes of high-energy gas are released from corona
- more solar activity = more sun spots

- high energy particles reach earth faster than photons
- The sun concerts mass into energy through **nuclear fusion**
- At low speeds, electromagnetic repulsion prevents the collision of nuclei
- At high speeds, nuclei come close enough for the strong force to bind them together
- Fusion happens at the core of the sun, the core is in that condition because of gravitational contraction
- The source of sun’s energy is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium

- Energy is transported upward by photons from the middle of the sun
    - NOTE: convection zone, photosphere, corona and radiation zone

![Untitled](Quiz%202%2046eafdec2c024680931ef3c7dfdb4530/Untitled%201.png)

- Once the photosphere is reached, energy radiates away into space

- **The suns shines steadily today because of gravitation equilibrium and energy balance**

- Decline in core temperature causes fusion rates to drop and core heats up/contracts (opposite for rise in core temp)
- DECLINE CORE TEMP → LOW FUSION → CONTRACT AND HOT CORE
- RAISING CORE TEMP → HIGH FUSION → EXPAND AND COOL CORE

******************************Luminosity******************************

- Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    
    ![Untitled](Quiz%202%2046eafdec2c024680931ef3c7dfdb4530/Untitled%202.png)
    
- Luminosity depends on temp and surface area of object (it is an INSTRINSIC property)
- **Inverse Square Law for Light**- Each amount of starlight that passes through each part of the sphere is the same amount (so the amount of light that passes through each sphere part is inverse square of distance from the star)

- To calculate brightness and luminosity:
-

- Parallax angle is small, distance can be approximated as
    - d(in parsecs) = 1/p (in arcsecs)
    

******************************Chapter 16******************************

- Apparent magnitude is denoted as m (how bright a star would look from its original distance)
- Absolute magnitude is denotes as M (how bright a star would look from a reference distance)
- Surface temperature range is much smaller than luminosity range
- Types of binary star systems:
    - Visual (Astrometric) binary
    - Spectroscopic binary
    - Eclipsing binary

*********Chapter 18*********

- Fusion energy increases the core temp, but the electron pressure does not increase with temp

- Younger stars have more metal
- Older stars have less metal

- Pulsars: Spinning neutron stars whose beam sweeps past ()Earth
