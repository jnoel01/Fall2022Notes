***Problem 1 (2 points)***

```
Explain if there'd still be seasons on Earth,
a) if Earth's axis has no tilt and is perfectly perpendicular to the exliptic plane
b) if Earth's axis is in the ecliptic plane
```

There would not be seasons if the Earth’s axis had no tilt, the reason that there are seasons is because of the tilted axis. Summer occurs (in that hemisphere) when the earth's axis is pointed toward the sun. Winter (in that hemisphere) occurs when the earth's axis is tilted away.

The Sun is about 27,000 light-years away from the center of our own galaxy.  
a) use the definition of light-year, i.e. distance light travels in a year,
to convert the Sun’s distance from the galactic center from light-years to km. 
b) use your answer in a) and the fact that 1AU = 1.5e8 km to figure out how
far the Sun is from the galactic center in AU. (i.e. can think of it roughly as how many Sun-Earth system can be packed in between)
```

a.) The distance between the Sun from the galactic center in kilometers in **2.55447e+17**

b.)  The Sun is **1.70298e+9** AU away from the galactic center

***Problem 3 (2 points)***

```
For a neutron star whose density is 5e17 kg/m3,
a) what would the mass of 1 teaspoon’s worth of the material from that
neutron star be? You can assume the volume of a standard teaspoon to be 5e-6 m3.
b.) how many empire state buildings (3.3e8 kg) would that be?
```

$ρ = mv$ ← Density Formula

m = mass & v = volume

$5e17 kg/m^3 = mass/(5e^-6 m^3)$

a.) 2.5**e**12 kg= mass of 1 teaspoon’s worth of neutron star

b.) 7575 Empire State Buildings

***Problem 4 (4 points)***

```
In class we learned the difference between keeping track of time relative to
distant stars and relative to the Sun, e.g. sidereal day vs. solar day. A
tropical year has 365.2422 solar days and 366.2422 sidereal days.
a.) What is the length of one sidereal day in terms of solar days?
b) If we know the average solar day is 24 hours, use your answer in a) to
figure out the length of one sidereal day in terms of hours, minutes and
seconds (in the format hh:mm:ss). 
c) Hypothetically, as part of a project to show Jupiter’s apparent motion
relative to distant stars, you took a first photo of Jupiter one night at
9:00:00 pm. You want to take a second photo the very next night and have all the distant stars show up at the same positions in your photo as the night
before (with exactly the same camera position and orientation), at what 
time (in the format hh:mm:ss) should you take the second photo?
```

a.) 1 tropical year = 365.2422 solar days

     1 tropical year = 366.2422 sidereal days

$365.2422 solar days / 366.2422 = 0.99727$

**One sidereal day in terms of solar days is 0.99727 solar days**

b.) 24 hours in one solar day → 1440 minutes → 86400 seconds ← Solar Day

$86,400 * 0.99727 = 86164.128$ seconds → 1436.0688 minutes → 23.93448 hours

$0.93448 * 60 = 56.0688$ minutes

$0.064 * 60 = 3.84$ seconds

**The length of one sidereal day in terms of hours, minutes and seconds is approximately 23:56:04** 

c.) Add 23:56:04 to 9:00:00 PM because that’s the same event time, which would equal **08:56:04 PM**

With the help of the diagram above, answer the following for the location of
Hoboken (latitude φ = 41 deg): 
a) What is the angle between the zenith and the north celestial pole? 
b) On the day of June solstice, when the sun is the highest in your local
sky, what is the angle between the sun and the zenith? 
c) On the day of March equinox, when the sun is the highest in your local
sky, what is the angle between the sun and the zenith?
```

a.) $90-41 = 49$ deg

The angle between the north celestial pole and the zenith is **49 deg**

b.) $43 - 23.5 = 17.5$ deg

The angle between the sun and zenith during this time is **17.5 deg**

c.) Latitude is 41 deg so the angle between the sun and zenith in the march equinox is **41 deg**

***Problem 6 (2 points)***

```
a) What is so special about Polaris? Is it because it’s the brightest star in the sky? If your answer is no, then explain why else Polaris is special.  
b) Was our north pole pointed at Polaris 13000 years ago? If not, sketch out the orientation of the north pole relative to Polaris today and 13000 years ago.
```

a.) Polaris is somewhat important because it’s bright but really Polaris is important because it always stays relatively in the same spot in the sky, it is very close to the celestial pole, so the North star is known for dictating the North direction to observers. 

b.) Our North star was not Polaris 13000 years ago so presumably our north pole was not pointed at Polaris.

***Problem 7 (1 point)***

```
Do lunar eclipses happen every single month? Explain your answer.
```

A lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth’s shadow, does not happen every month. This is because the Moon’s orbit is tilted and not in line with the Earth’s orbit around the Earth therefore the moon will not always pass directly through the shadow;
