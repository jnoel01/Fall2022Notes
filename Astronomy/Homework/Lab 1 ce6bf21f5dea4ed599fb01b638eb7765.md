*Mass of Jupiter*

In this lab I calculated the approximate mass of Jupiter by collecting various data on the moons of Jupiter. The data needed about each moon orbiting Jupiter was the semimajor axis and orbital period. Since online, most of the data regarding the semimajor axis and orbital periods are not in SI units, I converted them using Excel (into meters and seconds).  Utilizing Kepler’s third law

 $T^2=(4π/GM)*a^3$, “The Law of Periods” and the data collected one can calculate the mass of Jupiter. In our case “a” in the equation is referred to as R due to us using another “a” in the slope equation later on. The equation was also reduced to $(4π/GM) = a$, a being the “a” value in the slope equation (y=mx+b) that was found by plotting $R^3$ vs. $T^2$ and getting the line of best fit. Now that we have what all needed values in the reduced Law of Period equation, we can solve for M which is the mass of Jupiter. As shown below there are two different types of graphs for $R^3$ vs $T^2$: one that used data from 15 different moons orbiting Jupiter and one that only utilized data from the four Galileo moons. The former is considered the precise measurement and the latter is a  more approximate value.

The precise measurement resulted in Jupiter’s mass being 1.83593E27 kg and the approximate measurements (using only Galileo’s moons) resulted in Jupiter’s mass being 1.89766E27 kg. It is obvious that the difference in this estimated weight is  due to the varied moon data. The actual mass of Jupiter is 1.89813E27 meaning that my precise calculation had a percent error of -3.2769% and my approximate calculation had a percent error of -0.0248%.
