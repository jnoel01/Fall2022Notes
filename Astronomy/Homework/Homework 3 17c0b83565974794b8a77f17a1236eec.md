a.) wavelength peak = 2.898E6/T → = 2.898E6/29940

wavelength peak = 291.55 nm

**The wavelength where it’s radiation is the most intense is at 291.nm which is the ultraviolet wavelengths**

b.)  → LSirius/LSun =((1.71Rsun)^2 * 9940^4) / ((Rsun^2) * 5777^4) → = 25.6288

**The ratio of their luminosities of LSirius:LSun is 25.6288:1 or roughly 26:1**

a.) d = 1/p → d = 1/0.23 = **4.34782608696 parsecs**

1 parsec = 3.26 light years

1/3.26 = **4.34782608696/X → x = 14.174 light years**

**The distance to the star in parsecs is 4.3478 and the distance in light years is 14.1739**

b.) 1 light year = 1/3.26 parsecs

distance in parsecs = 46.7/3.26 parsecs → **14.3251533742 parsecs** 

p = 1/d → 1/14.3252 →  **0.0698 arcseconds**

**The parallax angle (in arcseconds) as observed from Earth (with the standard 1AU baseline) is 0.0698 arcseconds**

> **PROBLEM 3**
> 
> 
> Consider two stars Gliese 667C and Betelgeuse. From spectroscopic observations we conclude that they both have the same spectral type M1, and therefore the same surface temperature of ~3700 K. Further spectral feature analyses show that Gliese 667C has luminosity class of V (i.e. on the main sequence), and Betelgeuse has luminosity class of Ia (luminous supergiant).
> 
>  a) (3 pts) On the HR diagram below, pinpoint the locations of Gliese 667C and Betelgeuse by drawing a vertical line through the M1 spectral type, and find its intersection with the luminous supergiant and main-sequence luminosity class. From the locations of Gliese 667C and Betelgeuse on the HR diagram, draw horizontal lines towards the luminosity axis to determine the luminosities of these two stars. Write down the luminosities of Gliese 667C and Betelgeuse on the luminosity axis – a ballpark estimate from eyeballing the numbers on the axis is sufficient. You need to show this HR diagram with your drawings on it in your submission.
> 
> b) (2 pts) Based on the information in this question, what is the ratio of Gliese 667C’s radius to that of Betelgeuse, RGli / RBet ?

a.) **The luminosity of Gliese 667C and Betelgeuse is approximately  0.013 L and 79,432 L respectively according to the above diagram**

b.) 

![Untitled](Homework%203%2017c0b83565974794b8a77f17a1236eec/Untitled%202.png)

$R^2g/R^2b = Lg/Lb$ → 0.013/79432 = 1.636620002E-07

Take the square root of the result so → $√(1.636620002E-07)$ → 4.04E-4 → 0.000404 = Rg/Rb

**The ratio of Gliese 667C’s radius to that of Betelgeuse, Rg/Rb is 0.000404**
