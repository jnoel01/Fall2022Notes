# Observational Assignment 2

During this observational assignment I recorded the apparent motion of the moon in my local sky, which was in Hoboken, New Jersey. My exact coordinates were 40.743881,-74.024669 (by the UCC on Stevens campus). I took six photographs on November 13th, 2022 between the times 10:28pm EST and 11:35 EST with roughly 10 minute intervals between each photo. The phase of the moon that I observed was Waning Gibbous. The Waning Gibbous is the phase after the Full moon until the Third Quarter Moon, the illumination during this period ranges from 99% to 50.1%. The Waning Gibbous happens approximately 16 days after the most recent new moon. The Waning Gibbous is the sixth phase in the cycle of phases and occurs once a month and lasts approximately 7.38 days before transitioning into the Third Quarter. The moon first rose at approximately 8:30pm and headed ENE as I was observing it. The altitude continued to rise the later I took my picture (which is evident in the gif submitted). The altitude taken in my first photo at 10:28 PM EST is approximately 18° and during my third photo at 10:55 PM EST the moon altitude was approximately 23°  and during my final photo at 11:35 PM EST the approximate altitude was 30°. The highest altitude for this Waning Gibbous would be during the hour of 3am. As per my observation and the moon simulator, the moon rose from the east and will set in the west.

Below are screenshot simulations of the photographs I took during my observation, it evident that the moon is progressively getting less illuminated as it transitions closer to the Third Quarter and that the moon is traveling East:
