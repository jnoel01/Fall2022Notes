> a) (2 pts) In a spiral galaxy far far away, a star system 30,000 light years away from the center of that galaxy is orbiting around the center at a speed of about 300 km/s. Assuming the orbit is perfectly circular, what is the total mass in that galaxy enclosed within that star system’s orbit (in solar masses)?

a) M = (rv^2/GM)M → ((3E4*9.46E15*3E5^2)/(1.327E20)M) = **1.924E11 solar masses**

b) The total mass will **increase**.

 The result shows that **dark matter** makes up most of the universe as the result shows that there is **mass “not accounted” for in the galaxy.**

> In class we discussed how to measure distance on different scales. On very large scales, there is a Hubble flow due to the expansion of the Universe governed by Hubble’s law: cz = v = H0 d, where c is speed of light in vacuum, z is redshift, v is the recession speed, Ho is the Hubble constant and d is distance. (This linear relation between z and v is only valid for low redshift though.) If a galaxy is observed to have a redshift of 0.1. How far away is this galaxy (in Mpc)? (Use Ho= 70 km/s/Mpc.)

cz = v  → 3E5 * 0.1 = v → v = 3E4

v = Ho * d → 3E4 = 70d → 3E4/70  = d → d = 428.571 Mpc

The galaxy is **428.571 Mpc** away
