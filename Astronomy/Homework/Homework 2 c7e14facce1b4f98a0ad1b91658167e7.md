**Problem 1**
 
a) What’s the significance of the first supernova Tycho Brahe observed? (1 pt) 
b) Why didn’t Tycho detect stellar parallax? (1 pt) 
c) Why do we sometimes see Mars moving backward in the sky? (1 pt) 
d) List at least 2 pieces of evidence ancient philosophers/astronomers used to support
the Sun-centered model instead of the earth-centered model as we discussed in class. 
(2 pts)
```

a.) The significance of the first supernova was that it seemed like a star, however it was not a star and rather an explosion, this signaled the death of a star. The star was further away than the moon and among fixed stars.

b) Tycho could not detect stellar parallax because the stars were too far away for the naked eye to observed. Parallax angles are very difficult to measure from the Earth due to the effects of Earth’s atmosphere. Original telescopes also could not know the vast distance between us and other stars.

c.) We see mars moving backwards in the sky because when the Earth surpasses Mars during Earth’s orbital path, it appears that Mars is moving backward but it’s actually just Earth moving away from mars. This is known as “Mars Retrograde”.

d.) Copernicus proposed that the Sun was the center of the earth in a model which is known as heliocentric system. He arrived at this conclusion on the bases of other ancient philosophers and using his naked eye, but it wasn’t until Galileo observed Venus that the heliocentric model was able to be proved. Galileo found that Venus went through phases, similar to our moon. Phases are possible if Venus is going around the sun, not Earth. Therefore Galileo helped to concretely prove Copernicus’ heliocentric model

**Problem 2 (3 pts)**

A planet is orbiting a star of 1 solar mass with an orbital period of 60 months. What is the semimajor axis of the planet’s orbit?
```

$T^2 = (4pi^2/GM)a^3$

T = Earth Years

a = astronomical units AU

M = solar masses

4pi^2/G = 1 → $T^2 = a^3$

---

$Time = 5 years$

$(5^2)^1/3 = a$ → $a = (25)^1/3$ → $a =2.9 AU$

**The semi-major axis is 2.9 AU**

```
**Problem 3 (6 pts)**

NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is the first US mission to retrieve a sample from an asteroid (Bennu, mass 7.8e10 kg, radius 250 m) and return it to Earth. OSIRIS-REx was launched in 2016, arrived Bennu in 2018, and touched down on the asteroid on Oct. 20, 2020. Before
the touchdown, OSIRIS-Rex was orbiting the asteroid at a height of 2.0 km above the
surface of the asteroid. 
What was the orbital speed of the spacecraft in m/s? You can assume the asteroid is
spherical and the orbit is perfectly circular. (Feel free to review the lecture
slides/notes where we derived the expression for orbital speed.)
```

$mv^2 = GmM/r^2$

$v = (GM/r)^1/2$

$v = (6.67e-11)(7.8e10)/(2250)^1/2$

$v = 0.048 m/s$

```
**Problem 4 (8 pts)** 

In class we discussed how to use conversation of energy to figure out escape speed, the initial speed needed for a “satellite” object to escape (i.e. speed reduces to 0 when it reaches infinity). Recall that the total orbital energy is the sum of kinetic energy
(mv2/2) and gravitational potential energy (−GMm/r).  
Now, let’s use the same method to figure out the “impact speed”. Imagine a meteorite
heading towards Mars. If the meteorite’s speed is 0 when it’s infinitely far away from
Mars, what would its speed be when it hits the surface of Mars?  
You can think of it as the reverse of the “escape problem” discussed in class. List the initial kinetic energy and potential energy at infinity, as well as the final kinetic
energy and potential energy at impact. And you might want to look up the radius and mass of Mars.
```

$R = 3389.5 km$

$M=  6.39*10^23$

/math

= (-GM1M/R) + 1/2mv^2       → $sqrt(2GM1/R)$

$v = sqrt((2*6.67*10^-11 * 6.39*10^2.3)/3389.5*10^3))$     → $5.015*10^4$

**The speed when it hits the surface of mars would be *5.015e+3 m/s***

**Problem 5 (4 pts)** 

If the surface of Earth on average has a temperature of 15oC, what is the wavelength
(in nm) at which its blackbody radiation intensity is the highest? Which portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is it (e.g. visible, radio, etc.)?  
Hint: Wien’s law of blackbody radiation. Remember to convert the temperature into
Kelvin.
```

$Kelvin Temp = 273.15+25$               →                 $temp = 288.15K$

$Peak = 2.9828*10^-3 m.K/288.15K$               →             peak = 1.005726*10^5 meters

**Peak wavelength at which its blackbody radiation intensity is the highest is 10057.25 nanometers**

**The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is infrared**

```
**Problem 6 (2 pts)** 
In class we discussed the fundamental angular resolution limit of telescopes due to the wave nature of light. If you were to make an observation in the mm wavelength range (say centered at wavelength λ = 1 mm) with a 10 m telescope, what is the best angular
resolution you can reach (in arcmin)?
```

$wavelength = 1mm$     →      10 m $diameter$

$theta = 1.22 (10^-3)/10$    → = 1.22*10^-4

**Best angular resolution you can reach is 0.419 arcmin**
