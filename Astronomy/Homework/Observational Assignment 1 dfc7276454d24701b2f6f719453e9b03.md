# Observational Assignment 1

```
1.) Simulation
Write down the latitude of your current location and the date of your actual 
observation. Enter those into the simulator https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/sun-motion-simulator/ to simulate the path of the Sun in your local sky on that day. Take screenshots of your simulation at 3 time points: 6 am, 12 pm and 6 pm for the date of your observation. You can drag the needles on the 
clock to change the time of the day.
```

**Latitude:** 40.6°N

**Date of Observation:** September 26th, 2022

2.) **Actual Obesrvation**
Use a camera to record the motion of the Sun in your local sky with a sequence of at
least 6 photos, each about ten minutes apart. The Sun needs to be at
least partially visible in every single frame. The camera needs to be (more or less)
stationary throughout the sequence, so that the framing is the same for all photos.
Further, some landscape needs to be in the frame so that the motion of the Sun relative to the stationary landmark can be seen. You need to record the type of camera used (and camera settings if known), the date (mm/dd/yyyy)
and time (hh:mm:ss) of each shot, the azimuth/direction your shot is facing. 
For the azimuth/direction, no need for an actual numerical value; simply say something
like “I’m facing roughly south” is enough. Two options to show the
motion of the Sun you observed: 

**Option 1:** Overlay all photos in your sequence into one single photo. I’ll leave it up to you to explore and choose how you want to do this. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy – simply overlaying all photos and adjust their transparency will do, as long as the Sun in all individual shots are visible in the combined image. 
**Option 2:** Make a gif out of the series of stationary shots you took.

**3) Report writeup** 
Document what you did in part 1) and 2) in a report. In the report, you should: 
a) Provide a brief introduction of the project. 
b) List all the information mentioned in part 1) and 2), such as latitude, date, time
etc. 
c) Include the 3 screenshots from the simulation in part 1). Comment on whether the sun rises due east and sets due west in your simulation, and explain why (in terms of your location and the Sun’s location at a given season). 
d) Include the individual shots of the Sun from part 2), and label each shot 
with information such as the date and time as described in part 2). You have to show individual photos separately, not just a combined single frame. 
e) Include either the combined single frame or the gif to show the motion of the Sun. 
You also should include here one of the screenshots (doesn’t matter which one) of the
simulation from part 1) and highlight roughly where your observed motion falls on the
simulated path.

Understanding the motions in the sky allows us to understand how our solar system moves and what it is composed of. The motions in the sky from the view of Earth is due to the motion around the sun and their reflex motion.  Day and night occur because of Earth rotating on its axis which makes the Sun appear to move around the sky once each day. In this report we will analyze how the Sun is viewed from a specific location and give a few pictures that display the “suns movement around the sky” during an hour period.

Before taking photos of the sun from my point of view, I simulated it using a “motions of the sun” simulator. I entered my latitude into the simulator (40.6); this is because latitude can be measured by comparing one’s position on Earth using the sun's location (or North Star) and because the way one views the “suns motion in the sky” is different depending on latitude. I simulated the suns position in the sky during three different time intervals on September 26th, 2022: 06:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 06:00 all EST. Here is the result of inputting the aforementioned details into the “motions of the sun simulator”:

In the simulation, at the observer latitude of 40.6° N, it is evident that the sun rises due east around 06:50 AM EST sets due west around 06:40 PM EST. This is because of the Earth’s rotation on its axis. The Earth completes a full turn approximately every 24 hours and because the Earth turns towards the east it makes the sun appear as if it is moving west. Depending on the observers location on Earth, the sun will rise and set and different times, this is because of the Earth’s rotation and because depending on location the portion of the celestial sphere that is visible varies. Therefore the sun rises and sets in the Eastern part of the “map” before sun rise and set in the Western part respectively. Another reasons that the path of the sun in the simulator is the way it is, is because of seasons. Season are due to the sun angle changes over a years time- the Earth’s rotational plane is tilted 23.5° from the orbital plane around the sun. The path of the sun will be higher in during May, June and July in the northern hemisphere and during November, December and January the path of the sun is lower. Hence why the path in the simulation, at 40.6° N in September, is in between high and low, it is transitioning into it’s “low path” period.

After performing and analyzing the simulation, I took real time photos at the same latitude as the simulation, 40.6°N; using my iPhone 11 camera I captured the suns path in the sky on September 26th, 2022 in 10 minute intervals. Here is the result:

While taking these photos I was roughly facing South East (Latitude 40.6)

- The first photo (as seen below) was taken with an iPhone 11 camera at 09:15:00 EST on September 26th 2022.

- The fifth photo (as seen below) was taken with an iPhone 11 camera at 09:55:00 EST on September 26th 2022.
    
    ![5.jpg](Observational%20Assignment%201%20dfc7276454d24701b2f6f719453e9b03/5.jpg)

After taking each of the photos above, I combined them into a gif so that I could more clearly see the path of the sun, here is the result:

In relation to the simulation which was shown in the first part of the report, my real-time photos and path of the sun gif are approximately where the orange line and blue arrow are.
