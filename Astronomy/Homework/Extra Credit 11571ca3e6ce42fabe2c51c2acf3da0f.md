> Option 2: virtually visit an AMNH exhibit
> 
> 
> Go to AMNH exhibit website (e.g. [https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/meteorites  Links to an external site.](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/meteorites)), and pick at least /two/ items related to astronomy (the two don't need to be from the same exhibit), and write a paragraph or two (a couple of hundred words) about /each item/ what you learned and why you find them interesting.
> 
> Submit your writing on the two separate items in /one/ report. You need to cite the webpage of the exhibit/item.

           I virtually visited the Arthur Ross Hall of Meteorites which is divided into three sections, the origins of the solar system, the processes involved in building planets and meteorite impacts.  I first looked at the Meteorites exhibit and looked at Esquel and the Lunar Meteorite. I found that Esquel, which I learned was a pallasite meteorite looked very cool! I also looked at the fragments of Cape York, which were an interesting shape and reminded me of the moon. When looking at the exhibit that showed the inside of a meteorite, I found that they are shiny and almost a perfect surface. I learned from this exhibit that scientists often remove small pieces of meteorites to distribute them for research amongst a variety of laboratories.

   The next exhibit that I visited within the Arthur Ross Hall of Meteorites was the Origins of the Solar System exhibit. The front page of this exhibit spoke about the Allende fall which revolutionized the science of meteorites. I learned that this meteorite provided information on the processes within the Early Solar System. Allende weighed around four tons which the AMNH states was roughly the weigh of an Asian elephant, which is honestly not as heavy as I thought it would be. I was also surprised that it would be that loud of an explosion given the mass of it. Never the less, I was still found the remnants and origin story of Allende’s falling to be interesting!
