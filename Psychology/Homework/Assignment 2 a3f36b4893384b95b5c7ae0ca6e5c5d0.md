Assignment #2 – 5 points Must have a title page which includes the following
centered in the middle: Class Assignment #1, First and Last Name, Stevens 
Institute of Technology, HSS 175 – Fundamentals of Psychology, ProfessorNicholas Jones, September 23, 2022. The aforementioned items should be double spaced and centered on the first page. Please be sure to include page number(s) on the top right in the header. Directions 1. You will be tracking your sleep habits and 
your dream in order to analyze your habits and examine dream theories. 2. You 
must keep track of your sleep habits and dreams for a minimum of 3 days. 3. It 
may not be possible to remember all of your dreams during the night but it will be important to keep a paper and a pen or your phone next to your bed. If you 
are able to write something down as soon as you wake up would be better than 
trying to record your dreams after completing your morning routine. The details that you want to consider writing down is the location, what was happening, how did you feel, others present in your dream, and other details that come to your mind. You can write those details in your log. 4. In addition to your log that 
you will be submitting on Canvas, write a 1-2 page paper about your sleep habits based on information from the log. The items that you must include are the 
following a. What are your sleep habits. Do you go to bed at the same time every night? How many hours a night do you normally sleep? How could you be a better 
sleeper (quality or quantity)? Do you notice any patterns? What concepts from 
your text might apply to your sleep habits? b. What are your dreams. Why do you usually dream? Are there patterns or re- occurring themes? Is there any 
consistency between the things you do during the day and the dreams you have? 
c. Conclusion. What is the main purpose that we dream and why? Consider the 
theory or theories presented in the text.
