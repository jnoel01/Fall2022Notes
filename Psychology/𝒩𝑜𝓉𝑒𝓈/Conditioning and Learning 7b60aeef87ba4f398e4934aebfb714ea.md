# Conditioning and Learning

***Behaviorism***

- Pavlov
    - Responsible for classical conditioning
- Skinner
    - Responsible for operant conditioning

***Classical Conditioning Components***

- **Unconditioned Stimulus** - A stimulus that elicits a particular response without prior training
- **Unconditioned Response** - A response that occurs to a stimulus without prior training
- **Conditioned Stimulus** - A stimulus that does not elicit a particular response initially, but comes to do so as a result of CC
- **Conditioned Response** - The response that is eventually elicited by the conditioned stimulus after repeated pairings with the unconditioned stimulus

***4 Things to Know about CC***

1. CC generates multiple responses
2. CC establishes preferences and aversions
3. CC underlies various psychological conditions
4. Pairing the US and CS is NOT sufficient for conditioning to occur

***Operant Conditioning***

- **Operant Conditioning** - Occurs when a behavior is associated with a significant event

***Reinforcement and Punishment***

- Positive reinforcement: the reward is adding something desirable
- Negative reinforcement: the reward is ending something unpleasant
- Positive Punishment: something aversive or disagreeable is applied following an unwanted behavior
- Negative punishment: reduce an unwanted activity but by taking something desirable away

***3 Things to Know About Instrumental (Operant) Conditioning***

1. Instrumental Responses can occur under stimulus control
2. Operant Conditioning involves choice
3. Reinforcers are not made equal

***Observational Learning***

Also called Social Learning Theory

1. Attention
2. Retention
3. Initiation
4. Motivation
