    - Mental Health act created funding to train clinical psychologists
    - AAAP was founded by ??
    - These developments allowed for treatment of veterans returning home from WW II
    

***Research Designs***

- **Know the parts of experimental research: (given an example identify the groups_**
    - Experimental Group
    - Control Group
    - Two Variables: Independent and Dependent variable
    - Confounding Variables
- **Correlation**:
    - Correlation Coefficient
    - Identifying r value
- **Surveys**:
    - Know the positives and negatives of surveys
- **Quasi-Experimental Design:**
    - There is no random assignment of experimental groups (not as well designed as experimental design)
    - Different independent variables
    

***Brain & Nervous System***

- ***3 stages of human development:***
    - Zygote- the fertilized cell
    - Embryo - unborn
    - Fetus- offspring
- **The Central Nervous System:**
    - Encompasses the brain, spinal cord
- **Peripheral Nervous System:**
    - Everything outside of the brain and spinal cord
- **Basic Structure of a Neuron & what they do:**
    - Dendrites- tiny branch like structures
    - Axon- long slim tube
    - Soma- cell body
- **Split Brain:**
    - Operation performed to help prevent seizures
    - When the brain is split it will still function, just it won’t have the same capacity as a normal brain- because the communication is not the same as a put together brain
- **Lobes of the Brain and where they are:**
    - Frontal Lobe: decision making, personality and high level cognitive functions
    - Parietal Lobe: includes touch, pain, temperature, and the sense of limb position

***Nature and Nurture***

- Nature: your genetics
- Nurture: characteristics absorbed when you were raised
- Francis Galton and Charles Darwin started the debate of Nature V Nurture
- Animal Vs. Human Studies
    - Why can we do animal studies and not human studies (why is one done more than the other)
- **Behavioral Genetics:** Empirical science of how genes and environments work together (twin/adoption studies)
- **Heritability Coefficient-** Measures how strongly differences among individuals for a trait are related to differences among their genes

***States of Consciousness***

- **Examples of Low Awareness and High Awareness**
    - Low Awareness
        - Death, Coma, Sleep, Daydreaming, Non-conscious Processing
    - High Awareness
        - Decision-making, Mindfulness, Problem Solving

    - Stages of Sleep:
        - Stage 1: Light Sleep
        - Stage 2: Moderately Light
        - Stage 3: Transitional
        - Stage 4: Non-REM
        - Stage 5: REM-Dream Sleep
