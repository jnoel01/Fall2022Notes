# Cognitive Development in Childhood

***Continuous or Discontinuous Development***

- Continuous development is gradual in terms of quantitative changes that take place overtime
- Discontinuous development  is like a “step-up”
    - For example butterfly: caterpillar → cocoon → butterfly

***Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development***

1. Sensorimotor Stage (birth-2)
    1. Intelligence in action: child interacts with environment by manipulating objects; object permanence (peakaboo)
2. Preoperational Reasoning (2-6/7)
    1. Thinking dominated by perception, but child becomes more capable of symbolic functioning; conservation problem; language development occurs
3. Concrete Operational(6/7-11/12)
    1. Logical reasoning only applied to objects that are real or can be seen
4. Formal Operational (11/12-Lifetime)
    1. Individual can think logically about potential events or abstract ideas; advanced reasoning
