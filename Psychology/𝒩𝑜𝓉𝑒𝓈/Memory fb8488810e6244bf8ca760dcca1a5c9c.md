************************************************Stages of Memory************************************************

- Encoding- The initial experience of perceiving and learning events
- Recoding- Taking information from one form and converting it in a away that makes sense to us

- Memory Trace (engram)- The chance in the nervous system that represents our experience
- Consolidation- The neural changes that occur over time to create the memory trace of an experience

*******Retrieval*******

- Available- All information stored in memory
- Accessible- The information we are able to retrieve
- Encoding Specificity Principle- The effectiveness of retrieval cues

*********************Measuring Retrieval*********************

- Production Tests
    - Generation of studied info
    - Example = Free Recall
- Recognition Tests
    - Selection of studied info from aggregate info
    - Example: Multiple Choice True/False
