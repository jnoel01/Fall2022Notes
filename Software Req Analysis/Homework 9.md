# Homework 9

```
In this assignment, please conduct the field work to gather 10 User Requirements for Mobile Banking App.

The field work needs to be either in-person meeting or virtual meeting with at 
least 5 individuals (class mates, stevens students, professors, friends, 
family).

In meetings with them, you will elicit 5 unique User Requirements for the Mobile Banking App.

Please focus on non-obvious requirements. So for example, don't just write "The app should allow to check balance" or "The app should allow to deposit a check" Or "transfer money" or "it should have login and password for security" etc. - 
these would be very obvious requirements. Focus on unique requirements. Think 
out-of-the-box but practical requirements. Each student needs to submit 
individually. Please work independently. No late submissions will be considered.
