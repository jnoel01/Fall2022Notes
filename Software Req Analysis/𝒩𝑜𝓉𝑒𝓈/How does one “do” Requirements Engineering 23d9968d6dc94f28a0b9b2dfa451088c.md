# How does one “do” Requirements Engineering?

***Requirements Engineering Activities (QUIZ)***

- Requirements elicitation/discovery
- Requirements analysis and reconciliation
- Requirements representation/modeling
- Requirements verification and validation
- Requirements management
- There are others, but these are the “major” ones

***Requirements Elicitation/Discovery***

- Uncovering what the customer needs and wants
- It’s not picking apples! Requirements have to be found and/or teased out
- Also involves discovering who the stakeholders are (hidden stakeholders?)
- Don’t forget non-functional requirements

***Requirements Elicitation/Discovery***

- Involves uncovering what the customer needs and wants
- It’s not picking apples! Requirements have to be found and/or teased out
- Also involves discovering

***Stakeholders***

- People or orles who are affected, in some way by a system and so who can contribute requirements or knowledge to help you understand the requirements
- Can be internal or external to the organization
- Stakeholders can either be actively involved, directly affected by or can influence the outcome of a project

***Customers***

- Individual or organization that derives direct or indirect benefit from a product
- Could request, pay for, select, specify, ot use the product

***Users***

- customer who will interact with a system either directly or indirectly

***Typical Stakeholders***

- Customers (client, user)
- Sponsors (those who have commissioned and/or will pay for the system)
- All responsible engineering and technical persons (e.g. systems, development,test, maintenance)
- Regulators (typically, government agencies at various levels)
- Third parties that have an interest in the system but no direct regulatory authority (e.d standards organizations, users groups)
- Society (is the system safe?)
- Environment (for physical systems)
- Professors (e.g. for this course)

***Questions for Stakeholders***

- Whos is paying for the system?
- Who is going to use the system?
- Whos is going to judge the fitness of the system for use?
- What agencies (government) and entities )non-government) regulate any aspect of the system?
- What laws govern the construction, deployment and operation of the system?
- Who is involved in any aspect of the specification, design, construction, testing, maintenance, and retirement of the system?
- Who will be negatively affected if the system is built?
- Who else cares if this system exists or doesn’t exist?
- Who have we left out?
