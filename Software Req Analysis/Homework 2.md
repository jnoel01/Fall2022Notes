# Homework 2

```
Here is a partial listing of stakeholders for the Pet Store POS system:

Cashiers
Managers
System Maintenance Personnel
Store Customers
Inventory/Warehouse Personnel
Accountants/Sales Personnel
Give specific examples of conflicts between each pair of stakeholders listed
above for the Pet Store POS system.  In other words, the stakeholder 1 wants the system to do A while the stakeholder 2 wants the system to do B and in that case A and B are in some conflict with each other. Since there are 6 types of
stakeholders, there are 15 pairs to consider.   Your example for each pair
should be described in terms of how they would ask for a different requirement
for the system.  For example (and don't use this one):

Cashers might want a system that allows for easy refunding for item returns but the manager might want to require special protocols/approvals for refunding item returns. In this example the stakeholder pair in conflict is Cashier and Store
Manager. 

Think about your own experience as a customer going to a retail store to
purchase something and all the stakeholders (you as a customer, cashier, store
manager, system maintenance personnel in the store etc) and their requirements
and identify examples of potential conflicts.
